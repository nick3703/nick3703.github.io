					<h3>Bio</h3>
					<p>Dr. Nicholas Clark is an Associate Professor at the United States Military Academy. His areas of expertise include spatio-temporal statistical modeling, application of statistics and data science to problems in defense and national security, and program development and assessment of undergraduate data science programs.</p> 
					
					<p> Dr. Clark has published across a wide range of topics and is currently focusing on identifiability issues in spatio-temporal models for point process data. He also is currently a Co-PI for an NSF funded project entitled SCORE with Data. This projects creates case-based learning opportunities involving sports data for undergraduate students in data science courses. The project involves academics and industry professionals in sports. More information is available at <a href="scorenetwork.org">scorenetwork.org</a>. </p>
					
					<p>Dr. Clark was instrumental in creating the US Army's Data Literacy 101 education program and has also done work on developing an effective assessment process for data literacy education across large organizations.</p>
					
					<p>As an educator, Dr. Clark has over 7 years experience teaching at the undergraduate level. He has taught over 25 sections of 7 different undergraduate courses. He was instrumental in creating and currently serves as the program director for West Point's <a href="https://www.westpoint.edu/academics/academic-departments/mathematical-sciences/applied-statistics-and-data-science">Applied Statistics and Data Science Program</a> where he develops and runs the assessment program. He also is a trained ABET program evaluator for data science programs and is a leader in the development of undergraduate data science curricula.</p>
