improvement and reliability assurance processes in manufacturing
industries require data-driven reliability information for making
business, product-design, and engineering decisions. This will be a
hands-on workshop where participants will use the JMP 11 software for
analyzing reliability data and test planning. The course will focus on
concepts, examples, models, data analysis, and interpretation. Examples
and exercises will include examples using product field (maintenance or
warranty) data, accelerated life tests, and accelerated degradation
tests. After completing this course, participants will be able to
recognize and properly deal with different kinds of reliability data
and properly interpret important reliability metrics. Topics will
include the use probability plots to identify appropriate
distributional models (e.g. Weibull and lognormal distributions),
estimating important quantities like distribution quantiles and failure
probabilities, the analysis of data with multiple failure modes, the
analysis both destructive and repeated measures degradation data, and
the analysis of recurrence data from a fleet of systems or a
reliability growth program.</span><br style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px;">

<span style="font-style: italic;">Shape Metrology</span><br>
Shape metrology is a multidisciplinary program at the National
Institutes of Standards and Technology, involving statisticians,
mathmeticians, and scientists working in several different fields,
aiming to develop measurement services for the shape of objects
relevant to the execution of the agency's mission, which is to promote
U.S. innovation and industrial competitiveness by advancing measurement
science, standards, and technology in ways that enhance economic
security and improve our quality of life. This
presentation highlights several aspects of this program, to reveal the
contributions that methods of applied statistics are making to it,
including for the representation and measurement of shapes, in
particular of polymeric scaffolds used for tissue engineering, and of
mineral grains. We will also review how deformable templates are being
used in chemical spectroscopy. And in both cases we will discuss
probabilistic models that may be used to describe the variability of
the corresponding shapes.

Extremogram to Time Series and Spatial Processes</span></a><br>
In this talk, we discuss the application of the extremogram to the
modeling of heavy-tailed multivariate time series and spatial-temporal
processes. Like the autocorrelation function in time series, the
extremogram can be used in various phases of the modeling exercise for
heavy-tailed/extremal dependence in temporal and spatial processes.
First, the extremogram provides a measure of extremal dependence in the
data as a function of the time (or spatial) lag. Plots of the
extremogram must include confidence bands to assess significant
extremal dependence and this can be achieved using permutation
procedures and/or block bootstrap procedures. Second, the extremogram
can provide an assessment about how well the estimated extremogram
matches the population extremogram based on a fitted model. Finally,
the extremogram of residuals from a fitted model can be examined to see
if extremal dependence has been satisfactorily removed. We illustrate
the use of these ideas with several examples.<br>

of Large Networks</span></a>
<br>
A network clustering framework, based on finite mixture
models, is described. It can be applied to discrete-valued networks
with hundreds of thousands of nodes and billions of edge variables.
Relative to other recent model-based clustering work for networks, we
introduce a more flexible modeling framework, improve the
variational-approximation estimation algorithm, discuss and implement
standard error estimation via a parametric bootstrap approach, and
apply these methods to much larger datasets than those seen elsewhere
in the literature. The more flexible modeling framework is achieved
through introducing novel parameterizations of the model, giving
varying degrees of parsimony, using exponential family models whose
structure may be exploited in various theoretical and algorithmic ways.
The algorithms, which we show how to adapt to the more complicated
optimization requirements introduced by the constraints imposed by the
novel parameterizations we propose, are based on variational
generalized EM algorithms, where the E-steps are augmented by a
minorization-maximization (MM) idea. The bootstrapped standard error
estimates are based on an efficient Monte Carlo network simulation
idea. Last, we demonstrate the usefulness of the model-based clustering
framework by applying it to a discrete-valued network with more than
131,000 nodes and 17 billion edge variables.<br>

of a Time Series of Twitter Graphs</span></a><br>
In this talk I will describe a set of Twitter data that we have been
collecting for nearly two years. Using the Twitter streaming API, we
collect all tweets geolocated within a set of rectangles covering the
main land-masses of the world, as well as tweets containing certain key
phrases. We collect "all" geolocated tweets, in the sense that Twitter
provides all the tweets that are geolocated within the rectangle,
provided the volume does not excede a fixed limit. These tweets define
a "reference" digraph -- each screen name is a vertex and there is an
edge from s to t if a tweet from s refers to t: @s:"@t u wanna go to
lunch?". These reference digraphs can be computed on time intervals to
produce a time series of graphs. These graphs tend to have power law
degree distributions, and I will describe the graphs and discuss some
thoughts on how one might model these graphs. Using the graphs, I will
discuss methods for inferring node attributes, such as the geoposition
of a user whose tweet is not geolocated, or detecting spoofed
geolocations.<br>

Oranges: Complex System Reliability with Multi-Modal Testing</span></a><br>
We
describe a hierarchical model for assessing the reliability of
multi-component systems. Novel features of this model are the natural
manner in which failure time data collected at either the component or
subcomponent level is aggregated into the posterior distribution, and
pooling of failure information between similar components. Prior
information is allowed to enter the model in the form of actual point
estimates of reliability at nodes, or in the form of prior groupings.
Censored data at all levels of the system are incorporated in a natural
way through the likelihood specification. We demonstrate a fully
Bayesian approach with incorporation of diverse data types, including
discrete, continuous, and censored data at multiple data collection
levels (components versus systems). The framework introduced includes
accommodation for many commonly encountered system structures,
including series, parallel, k out of n, and more complex Bayesian
networks. We illustrate the methodology on an actively developed DoD
system.<br>

<a href="Samorodnitsky_TailsBegin30.pdf"><span style="font-style: italic;">Tail Inference: Where
Does the Tail Begin?</span></a><br>
The quality of estimation of heavy tail parameters, such as tail index
in the univariate case, or the spectral measure in the multivariate
case, depends crucially on the part of the sample included in the
estimation. A simple approach involving sequential statistical testing
is proposed for choosing this part of the sample. This method can be
used both in the univariate and multivariate cases. It is
computationally efficient, and can be easily automated. No visual
inspection of the data is required. We establish consistency of the
Hill estimator when used in conjunction with the proposed method, as
well describe its asymptotic fluctuations. We compare our method to
existing methods in univariate and multivariate tail estimation, and
use it to analyze Danish fire insurance data.<br>

<a href="NolanCASD2014.pdf"><span style="font-style: italic;">Computational Tools for
Non-Gaussian Multivariate Distributions</span></a><br>
In an increasing number of applications, there are multivariate data
sets that are poorly modeled by a Gaussian distribution. This can be
due to non-elliptical spread of the data. For this type of data, we
describe the generalized spherical distributions, a class of
distributions that are determined by a contour (the level curve of the
density) and a radial decay function. An R software package
GeneralizedSpherical implements a flexible family of such
distributions. This gives a versatile tool for modeling non-standard
distributions.<br>

<a href="Towsley_CASD.pdf"><span style="font-style: italic;">Sampling Heavy-Tailed
Multivariate Distributions on Large Networks</span></a><br>
Estimating characteristics of large graphs via sampling is a vital part
of the study of complex networks. Current sampling methods based on
(independent) random vertex and random walks (RWs) have been shown to
be useful when the graph underlying the network is undirected. In
particular, sampling based on random walks has been shown to be
particularly effective for characterizing the tail of distributions
strongly related to the degree distribution. However, many large
networks are directed (e.g., Twitter, Wikipedia, Flicker) and the
quantities of interest are often multivariate, in-degree and out-degree
being prime examples. In this talk, we explore various random walk
based sampling algorithms, paying particular attention to their
effectiveness in characterizing the joint in-degree/out-degree
distribution. In particular, we examine how the underlying graph
supporting the RW affects the quality of the characterization. For
example, should the walker ignore edge direction? Travel in/against the
direction of the edges? We also examine how the dependence between
in-/out-degrees affects the performance of RW-based estimation. Last,
we will examine other characteristics such as reciprocity and
clustering coefficient.<br>

Regular Variation: Generation and Detection</span></a><br>
We review definitions of multivariate regular variation (MRV) and
hidden regular variation (HRV) for distributions of random vectors and
then summarize methods for generating models exhibiting both
properties. We also discuss diagnostic techniques that detect these
properties in multivariate data and indicate when models exhibiting
both MRV and HRV are plausible fits for the data. We illustrate our
techniques on simulated data and also two real Internet data sets.

Methods in Data Mining</span></a><br>
Ensemble
methods are one of the true disruptive technologies in data mining and
machine learning. The simple idea of combining multiple models into one
usually leads to significant improvements in model performance. We
highlight two recent developments in ensembles: Importance Sampling and
Rule Ensembles and show how these methods are generalizations of
classical ensembles methods including bagging, random forests, and
boosting. Finally, we explain the paradox of how ensembles achieve
greater accuracy on new data despite their apparently much greater
complexity by showing the connection between ensemble methods and
regularization techniques.<span style="font-family: monospace;"><br>

maturation
of technologies to support contextual understanding and event
prediction for
military operations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Information
is
required from a variety of sources and diverse formats to support
awareness of
cultures, attitudes, events, and relationships in an area of interest.
Text
analytics is the organizing domain of this program and refers to the
linguistic, statistical, and machine learning techniques that model and
structure the information content of text sources for exploratory data
analysis, research, and investigation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The contextual understanding component of this program
supports the
discovery of events, stated values and beliefs that motivate behaviors
of
interest, discovery of topics and concepts in a shared community,
analysis of
semantic relationships and associated strength, community structure and
clusters of social networks, and semantic analysis and trending of
support expressed
in text toward topics or persons.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The
event prediction aspect of D2D seeks to advance capabilities for
extracting
events from unstructured text with the following aspects:
identification of
proxy features of a network, temporal trend extraction and
characterization,
visual and semantic analysis at scale, key actor and supported
relationship
associations, and detection of bridging nodes that can uncover hidden

Over
the last decade, the Department of Defense has begun to recognize the
importance of human dimensions in military operations. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Modeling, predicting and
evaluating social
processes has become critical for DoD planning and long-term goals,
especially
in the climate of the full spectrum of modern operations, e.g.
humanitarian
aid, disaster relief, foreign nation stability and security,
intelligence
gathering, community building, and technological infrastructure. Beyond
understanding the social context of our operational landscape, we also
need to
understand the social processes of military teams and units that carry
out
these specialized and diverse missions. Research that investigates the
cognitive and social dynamics that lead to wise decision making and
peak
performance is critical for predicting, evaluating and building
successful units.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Social &amp; Cognitive Networks program
at the Army Research Office (ARO) has been initiated to direct and

Application of Component and System Reliability Concepts and Methods to
Analysis of Survey Participation</a><br>
In the
analysis of survey participation, two phenomena have some similarities
to patterns studied in work with component and system
reliability.&nbsp; For purposes of this discussion, we define
&#8220;component and system reliability&#8221; broadly to involve a trajectory of
events (e.g., failure and possible recovery of specified system
components or of an overall system) and associated measurements of
underlying component or system characteristics.&nbsp;The first
phenomenon is the initial decision of a selected sample unit to
participate in the survey.&nbsp; Predictors of this decision may
include underlying characteristics of the unit (e.g., the size and
industrial classification of a selected business; or the demographic
characteristics of a selected household).&nbsp; In addition, the
sample unit&#8217;s decision may occur after a series of attempts by the
survey organization to contact the unit and to persuade it to
participate.&nbsp; Survey methodologists wish to understand as much
as possible about the ways in which the timing of the decision to
participate, and related negotiations (the &#8220;trajectory of events&#8221; of
interest here) are linked with the abovementioned unit characteristics,
and with measurements recorded during the negotiations (e.g.,
indicators of the degree of reluctance to participate).&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>The
second phenomenon is the decision of a selected sample
unit to stop participating in the survey after an initial decision to
cooperate.&nbsp; For example, in a single-period survey with a
total of A sections in a questionnaire, the selected unit may respond
to the first B sections, but then decline to respond to the remaining
A-B sections.&nbsp; To take another example, in a panel survey
(i.e., a survey in which a sample unit is asked to provide responses in
each of P periods), the unit may participate for the first K periods,
but choose not to participate for the remaining P &#8211; K periods.
&nbsp;The decision to stop participating may be associated with the
unit characteristics mentioned in the preceding paragraph, or with
experiences that arise during earlier parts of the survey collection
(e.g., questions that are perceived to be sensitive or
burdensome).&nbsp; For these cases, the &#8220;trajectory of events&#8221; may
include the number of sections (or periods) of survey participation
before the unit stops responding; measures of the quality of the
responses received; and indications of question sensitivity or burden
for the unit. For both
phenomena, statistical issues include development of models for the
abovementioned trajectories.&nbsp; For the second phenomenon,
statistical issues also include efforts to characterize and model a
prospective &#8220;recovery pattern&#8221; that results from efforts to persuade
the &#8220;dropout&#8221; unit to resume responding.

Building
Requirements-Flow Models Using Bayesian Networks and Designed
Simulation Experiments</a></span><br>
System-level
requirements must usually be decomposed into several lower-level,
&#8220;derived&#8221; requirements before system- and component-level design work
can proceed. In the past, various ad-hoc graphical methods have been
used to visualize and articulate the set of derived requirements.
Ambiguous references are often made to &#8220;probabilities&#8221; (i.e., joint,
conditional, or marginal probabilities). These methods and references
have proven useful to guide design decisions. However, when the time
arrives to verify compliance with the requirements or to troubleshoot a
non-compliant case, issues often arise. Bayesian
networks offer a more rigorous method of constructing a related set of
derived requirements. Initially developed during the 1980s within the
artificial intelligence community, Bayesian networks have proven to be
a useful tool for creating a logically consistent probability model of
a set of verifiable requirements. The model consists of (1) a directed
acyclic graph, (2) a set of fully defined states for each node in the
graph, and (3) a conditional probability table (CPT) for each of the
nodes. Probability estimates in each CPT are first made by mining data
from designed simulation experiments on prior, similar systems; the CPT
entries are then altered as deemed necessary to satisfy top-level
requirements for the system under current design. This paper describes
the method for constructing and evaluating
Bayesian networks. Central to the construction and evaluation of
Bayesian networks are designed simulation experiments. Examples are
given to illustrate the use of simulation experiments in constructing
and reasoning about the flow between requirements within a Bayesian
network. Major benefits of using Bayesian networks are reported,
including the ability to analyze design margin, to allocate subsystem
tolerances, and to estimate the achievable upper bound on system
performance for a proposed subsystem design improvement.<br>

scenarios of interest to the defense and intelligence communities, such
as attacks on guarded facilities, involve multiple autonomous actors
operating concurrently and interactively. These scenarios cannot be
modeled realistically with methods such as stochastic game theory,
Markov processes, event graphs, or Bayesian networks, which assume
sequential actions, serialized sample paths, or situations static in

concurrency in computer architectures, offer a powerful graphic tool
for eliciting scenarios from experts, as well as a basis for simulating
scenario outcomes&nbsp; In this talk we describe how generalized
stochastic Petri nets can be used for deriving statistical properties
of dynamic scenarios involving any number of concurrent actors. We
illustrate with an application to site security, implemented using an
object-oriented framework for stochastic Petri net simulation developed

via Exponential Families</span></a><br>
Markov Random Fields, or undirected graphical models are
widely used to model high-dimensional multivariate data. Classical
instances of these models, such as Gaussian Graphical and Ising Models,
assume all variables arise from the same distribution. Complex data in
modern settings however, from high-throughput genomics and social
networking for example, often contain discrete, count, and continuous
variables all measured on the same set of samples. Statistical modeling
of such mixed or heterogeneous data presents an important and pressing
problem in modern data analysis. Towards this, we develop a novel class
of mixed graphical models by specifying that each node-conditional
distribution is a member of a possibly different univariate exponential
family. We discuss several instances of our class of models, and
propose scalable M-estimators for recovering the underlying network
structure. Simulations as well as an application to learning mixed
genomic networks from next generation sequencing and mutation data
demonstrate the versatility of our methods.<br>

Under Informative Sampling</span></a><br>
The
Bayesian hierarchical framework provides readily estimable models for
capturing complex dependence structures expressed within a population.
Yet, there remains an open question about how to perform Bayesian
estimation when the observed sample data are acquired under an
informative design. Typically recommended methods require
parameterizing the sampling design or conditional expectations of
inclusion into the model, which may conflict with desired inference or
disrupt estimation. We propose two new approaches that are implemented
with common, nearly automated procedures employing weights that encode
the sampling design (and response propensities) using first order
inclusion and response probabilities for observed units. The first
approach conducts an inverse inclusion probability-weighted resampling
of the observed data to produce a set of pseudo-populations on which we
estimate our model parameters. The process performs a Monte Carlo
integration over the conditional population generating distribution,
given the observed data, and accounts for uncertainty from both finite
population generation and estimation of parameters. The second approach
develops a weighted adjustment to full conditional posterior
distributions that incorporates sampling weights into specifications
for hyperparameter statistics that depend on both the data and weights,
directly, and also through non-sampled parameters. A key feature of our
approaches is that they don't alter the population model
parameterization. Our motivating application is composed of
time-indexed, functional observations for reported employment count
errors among a set of business establishments. The errors emanate from
a dual reporting requirement for both the Quarterly Census of
Employment and Wages (QCEW) and the Current Establishment Survey (CES).
These data were collected under a stratified design. Our modeling
performs unsupervised inference on the number of and memberships in
clusters of parameters generating the latent time-indexed functions.<br>

<span style="font-style: italic;">Convergence of Cyclic
Stochastic Optimization and Generalizations</span><br>
A common problem in applied mathematics is the minimization of a loss
function L(<span style="font-family: Symbol;">theta</span>)
with respect to a parameter vector theta. In many practical
applications, however, the loss function output is corrupted by noise;
the loss function itself is unknown. As a consequence, traditional
deterministic optimization algorithms are not applicable. Such
situations arise in many problems, including so-called online training
of neural networks, simulation-based optimization, and stochastic
control. Instead, stochastic optimization methods such as stochastic
gradient (SG) and simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation
(SPSA) can be used. Both methods are iterative in nature yielding a
value theta-hat-k (the latest estimate for a minimizer of the loss
function) at the kth iteration. In<br>
this technical paper we discus a
cyclic version of stochastic optimization where only a strict subset of
the parameters of theta updated at a time while holding the remaining
parameters fixed. There are many reasons we might be interested in such
a setting. Briefly, such reasons include possible increase in
stability, improved convergence rate, and the possibility to combine
different methods for updating each parameter subset. In addition, it
has also been observed that large differences in parameter magnitudes
can have a significant impact on performance in methods like SG. Many
methods such as the expectation maximization and and k-means exhibit a
similar alternating nature. Here we prove convergence of cyclic
versions of SG and SPSA with a few generalizations. Future work would
include analyzing the rate of convergence of such algorithms and an
application to multiagent optimization.<br>

it can

period of
idleness, analogous to survivability in reliability theory. The
distribution
can also be used to estimate the conditional probability of a host

This paper will outline a method for comparing parametric
manufacturing tests statistically against one another and provide an
overview
of a software application that implements the described method. In the
course
of the normal manufacturing cycle discrete parts are tested under
pre-defined
test operations. With the time of the test and the serial number of the
unit
under test a unique parametric test result is created. This &#8220;test
result&#8221; contains
<i style="">n</i> number of individual measurements.
Looking at the test result as its own unique data set comprising a
collection
of measurements, we can compare the shape of one test result to any
number of other
test results to create a rank order list of similar test results.
Normalizing
the data points within the test results relative to their historic
behavior and
performing a Pearson correlation provides a method to compare the
results.
Given a high correlation coefficient between the failure/behavior mode
of a
test under review and another test we can suggest that using a similar
corrective action to address the current failure/behavior mode will
produce a
similar result. Significantly, the normalization and correlation
calculation
for the entire set of test results being reviewed is completed in a
single
step.<span style="font-family: monospace;"><br>

Model for a Small Unit</span></a><br>
The
Autonomous Squad Member (ASM) project is a research effort to develop
an intelligence that would allow a ground robot to support a dismounted
unit with little human direction and intervention. Such an intelligence
must make predictions of the future actions of the soldiers it
supports, both in order to plan given current priorities, and in order
to detect events which might signal a change in those priorities. To
support this effort, we have developed a model of squad movement which
allows the robot to estimate possible future positions of the squad,
and the likely times of arrival at those positions, over a variety of
possible unit priorities. Specfically, we apply the A* algorithm to
bound the small unit's movement to a specified area based on an a
priori map of the terrain, known mission constraints, and a weighted
combination of costs, where the weight is derived from a possible
mission context. By varying these weights, we can develop a diverse
population of paths which represent the predicted position of the unit.
We further model the time at which arrival at a given cell is likely to
occur. The method by which we implement our model also allows for
inference of mission contexts based on the actual path taken.<br>

</o:p>Statistical power is a common metric for assessing
experimental designs. While this metric depends on many factors, one of
the most critical is the expected effect size of relevant factors and
the relative noise expected in the data. Together, these values are
summarized as the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Software packages like
JMP 10 and Design Expert use SNR as a critical component in power
calculations, and by general &#8220;rule of thumb&#8221;, values such as 0.5, 1,
and 2 are used. However, it is not clear that these values represent
the true spectrum of likely outcomes from operational test data. Due to
the operational realism strived for in such testing, there are often
many sources of uncontrolled variation, making it difficult to plan an
appropriate test based on the SNR. In this talk, we summarize observed
SNRs from a wide spectrum of operational tests and discuss how this
data might be used for planning future tests using a case study
approach.<br>

Program (ACMP) at the United States Military Academy.&nbsp;
Previously, to
place into the ACMP, cadets we required to take and pass a summer
validation exam. This created a large burden for instructors to
administer and grade the placement test, but, more importantly, placed
an additional requirement on new cadets&#8217; already full summer training

whether
cadets with satisfactory AP scores on the Calculus examinations should
be offered admittance in the Advanced Core Mathematics Program (ACMP),
without having to take the summer validation exam.&nbsp; We define
success
as achieving some form of A or B in the first course of the
ACMP.&nbsp;
Using tree-based methods and logistic regression we compared the
predictive power of placement models based solely on AP scores with
placement models based on AP and summer validation exam
scores.&nbsp;
Additionally, we considered models that included other metrics

<span style="font-style: italic;">The Economy and Enlisted
Retention in the Navy</span><br>
At the end of their service obligations, sailors decide whether to
reenlist in the Navy or to enter the civilian workforce. The Navy is a
closed labor force: it relies solely on sailor retention to maintain
its ranks and grow senior leadership. Retention forecasts affect
planning of all personnel functions, like readiness, advancements, and
recruiting. Generally, a decline in the economy is correlated with high
retention and, during times of economic expansion, the Navy struggles
to retain sailors. But, without knowing the functional form behind this
relationship, drafting personnel policies or accurately budgeting for
retention incentives is challenging. Using 20 years of data, we model
retention as a function of the civilian economy and sailor attributes.
Going beyond the unemployment rate to represent the economy, we use
various statistical methods to account for multicollinearity of
economic indicators, economic tipping points, and retention climate
effects. Our model can be used to forecast Navy retention as a function
of the civilian economy. We combine our results into useful and usable
tripwires to help Navy leaders identify when retention policies need to
be activated.<br>

TAR, SEHM, and HMM Frameworks in Modeling the Activity Profile of
Terrorist Groups</span></a><br>
There
has been ongoing interest in modeling the activity profile of terrorist
groups over the last few decades. Pioneered by Enders and Sandler,
initial work in terrorism modeling focused on time-series analysis
techniques such as threshold auto-regression (TAR) models. More recent
developments in this area have been along two directions. The first
approach leverages a self-exciting hurdle model (SEHM) popularized in
diverse applications such as seismology and gang warfare modeling. The
second approach builds a hidden Markov model (HMM) framework to capture
terrorist group dynamics. The focus of this work is on a comparative
analysis of the TAR, SEHM and HMM approaches to model the activity
profile of different terrorist groups. While model comparisons have
been done for individual terrorist groups (or across multiple groups
spread over a region) in the literature, the focus here is on
addressing the commonalities/divergences of the three frameworks across
a large class of groups with specific proclivities (leftist, Islamist,
ethno-chauvinistic, etc.). While all the three models assume that the
current observation/activity in a terrorist group is dependent on the
past history of the group, the models differ in how this dependence is
realized. In the TAR model, the current observation is explicitly
dependent on the past observations along with (possibly) the impact
from other independent variables corresponding to certain geopolitical
events/interventions. In the SEHM, the probability of a future attack
is enhanced by the history of the group. The HMM combines both these
facets by introducing a hidden state sequence. The state sequence
depends explicitly on its most immediate past (one-step Markovian
structure), whereas the probability of an attack is enhanced based on
the state realization. Explanatory and predictive powers (of past and
future attacks, respectively) of these three models are also studied
and contrasted.<br>

acceptance limit for this plan, pegged to a &#8220;90/90 standard,&#8221; was 17
penetrations.&nbsp; Rep. Louise Slaughter (NY) challenged the new
plan, concerned that it could lead to a reduced level of soldier

populations provides a useful resource for studying common diseases and
their
component traits. Well-characterized human populations provide
excellent
opportunities for epidemiologists and clinical scientists to study the
associations between biomarkers or genes and biological disease.
Analysis of
biomarkers frequently involves regression of high dimensional data.
This is
problematic when the number of observations is limited. The dependency
among
various biomarkers cannot be avoided and the collinearity makes
unbiased and
stable conclusions difficult. The goal of this study is to find a
particular
partition of the space<b style=""> X</b>, such that
each subspace consists of all independent factors. We propose a
three-step approach:
1. Decomposing the sample space; 2. Finding an orthogonal base
including the
most significant linear combination of biomarkers, which can be used to
identify the cases most efficiently; and 3. General linear regression
based on
the vectors generated in step 2 to evaluate the multiple biomarker
associations
with the disease, and identify new cases. A new sum statistic and its
distribution are developed to be used test the biomarker simultaneously
for
biomarker selection. We used the proposed approach to determine the
potential
association of serum biomarkers derived from a case-control study of
schizophrenia. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed
Decomposition

Abundance (N) is a key
descriptor of a central concept in ecology and epidemiology, the
population.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Host
abundance is
intrinsically linked to our knowledge of pathogen-host dynamics and the
deterministic/stochastic
mechanisms driving these systems. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Unfortunately,
individuals are always
overlooked so N can never be directly observed. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Classical
mark-recapture methods to estimate N
are well developed, however the extra-information comes at a physical
and
administrative cost due to individual identification of each animal. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>An alternative methodology
uses counts from
spatially and temporally replicated samples to derive estimates of N in
a
hierarchical modeling framework.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
technique is applied to demonstrate the utility of hierarchical
modeling in
estimating the impact on an ecologically relevant parameter from the
experimental control of the Yellow Fever mosquito (<i style="">Aedes
aegypti</i>) using pyriproxyfen, a juvenile hormone analog.<o:p></o:p></span><br>

<span style="font-style: italic;">An R Plugin Package For
Geospatial Analysis</span><br>
We have produced a menu-driven package as a plugin package from the
Rcmdr (Fox, 2005) that performs geospatial analysis
on spatial and spatio-temporal data sets. Kriging is used for both
types of data.&nbsp; Then Google Earth maps are produced
based on the kriging results.&nbsp;The spatio-temporal Google maps
show the results over time.&nbsp; These maps can be displayed
on such devices as iPads or smartphones.<br>
