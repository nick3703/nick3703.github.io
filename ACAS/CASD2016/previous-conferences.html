					<h1>Previous Conferences</h1>
					<p>The Conference on Applied Statistics in Defense, originally the Army Conference on Applied Statistics, was established in 1995 by six sponsoring activities within the national defense community. In the ensuing years, the organization has broadened its mission to include a broader range of problems in defense and security and has attracted more industry, academia, and other government agencies. In 2013, the conference was renamed to reflect the broadening role. The present direction represents a natural progression from being a conference under Army direction (1995-2004) to one under the direction of the Interface (2005-2012) to one that continues under the Interface but with an expanded role in the statistical community. CASD is the successor to the Conference on the Design of Experiments in Army Research, Development, and Testing, a historic series of meetings that formally concluded in 1994 after 40 years of service to the Army.</p>
