<P>The Sixth U.S. Army Conference on Applied Statistics was hosted by Rice
University, 18-20 October, 2000. The conference was co-sponsored by the
U.S. Army Research Laboratory (ARL), the U.S. Army Research Office (ARO),
the United States Military Academy (USMA), the Training and Doctrine Command
(TRADOC) Analysis Center-White Sands Missile Range, the Walter Reed Army
Institute of Research (WRAIR), and the National Institute for Standards
and Technology (NIST). Cooperating organizations included RAND, Los Alamos
National Laboratory, George Mason University, Office of Naval Research,
and the Institute for Defense Analysis. Approximately 100 people attended,
making this conference the best attended since a 1982 Design of Experiments
Conference in Monterey, CA. A bulletized accounting of the conference program

<P>Bacteria contain a number of genes that contribute to their ability to
cause human infections and to resist the action of antibiotics. However
only a subset of bacteria within a given species contain these genes. Thus,
some bacteria of a species contain only a few genes involved in infection,
while others contain many such genes. These pathogenicity and antibiotic
resistance genes can be transferred between bacteria of the same species
and often between bacteria of different species. In addition, these genes
can be inserted into bacteria in the laboratory by recombinant DNA techniques,
which facilitates the design and construction of bacteria that are highly
virulent and also resistant to most antibiotics. Engineered bacteria of
this type represent possible biological warfare or terrorism agents. Genomics
technologies such as high-throughput sequencing and DNA chips, are mechanisms
by which the constellation of pathogenicity and antibiotic resistance genes
of any bacterial isolate can rapidly be assessed.</P>

<P>As part of the MOUT ACTD, a simulation study was conducted to determine
the operational effects, with respect to communication, on clearing a building
floor consisting of a series of rooms in a typical urban setting. The Blue
force was attacking and the Threat force was defending the floor. Prior
to the force-on-force simulations, the study agency wanted to determine,
in advance, the probable communication locations (or nodes) on the floor
that the attacking force would use to coordinate the attack. Subject matter
experts (SMEs) were given floor diagrams and a detailed description of the
scenario and asked to identify all the possible places they believed that
communications would occur. A clustering algorithm was used to determine
if the group of SMEs were reasonably consistent among themselves as to the
location of the subjectively positioned communication nodes. This paper
will present the results of this portion of the study and a simple measure
of subjective clustering effectiveness.</P>

Operations Center (TOC) Shelter Designs<BR>
</FONT></I><FONT COLOR="#ED181E">Jock Grynovicki, Kragg Kysor, and Madeline
Swann, U.S. Army Research Laboratory</FONT></P>

<P>The U.S. Army currently fields the Standard Integrated Command Post System-Extensions
(SICPS-E) tent shelter system with its command post vehicles to form a tactical
operations center (TOC). Although the currently fielded SICPS-E system contains
a common workspace, it does not provide an open architecture within which
staffs can better perform their functions. An open architecture allows for
the uninterrupted view of Command Information Center (CIC) displays and
unimpeded movement of personnel within the shelter. Given that the currently
fielded SICPS-E system is not ideal, the issue becomes &quot;What type of
form should future TOCs take?&quot;</P>

<P>In early 1997, the Vice Chief of Staff, Army (VCSA) established a policy
to address TOC development. The intent was to leverage all of the financial
and intellectual efforts from across many communities to focus on systems
that provide commanders and their staffs the facilities and information
required for making military decisions. Subsequently, the Training and Doctrine
Command (TRADOC) Program Integration Office-Army Battle Command System (TPIO-ABCS)
was assigned the responsibility for focusing TOC development.</P>

<P>In early 1999, HQ TRADOC and the Army Digitization Office (ADO) requested
that a high-level body (i.e., &quot;TOC Summit&quot;) address the issues
that resulted from the complexity of TOC development. Through the TOC Summit
venue, it was recognized that the currently fielded SICPS-E system may not
suffice as the sheltering system for future U.S. Army TOCs. The Commander,
Combined Arms Center (CAC) directed the TRADOC Analysis Center-Fort Leavenworth
(TRAC-FLVN) to provide analyses to inform a November 2000 decision on the
form to select for the Army's future division-level and brigade-level TOCs.
Consequently, TRAC-FLVN requested that ARL-HRED provide human factors analysis
support for the November 2000 decision regarding a (1) Mobile Expandable
Container Configuration (MECC) and a (2) Custom Tent design. As part of
a &quot;Cognitive Engineering of the Battlefield&quot; Science and Technology
Objective (STO), the ARL-HRED developed a survey instrument to assess human
factors, battlefield management, collaboration, modularity, mobility and
security issues. This paper presents an approach to the statistical data
collection, human factors analysis, and quantitative results that will be
provided to support the decision makers on the form (i.e., platform or shelter)
to select for the U.S. Army's future division-level TOCs.</P>

<P>Machine translation (MT) is a computer-based application that seeks to
convert the content of a passage provided in one human language to another.
The Army, in particular, with its land operations in foreign countries and
its use of coalition forces, stands to benefit from translation tools. Defense
efforts like the Army's Forward Area Language Converter program and the
Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Trans-lingual Information Detection,
Extraction and Summarization program are examples of ongoing efforts to
leverage and develop translation tools to support the soldier at all echelons.
In earlier studies, a variety of evaluation techniques were employed. Most
involved subjective assessments of translation quality, emphasizing the
correctness of syntax, morphology, and semantics. Our research explores
the use of reading comprehension tests to establish a baseline in the evaluation
of MT technology. This paper describes the results of a pilot study in which
we employ a standardized reading comprehension test to assess the effectiveness
of a French MT system.</P>

Measurements<BR>
</FONT></I><FONT COLOR="#ED181E">Robert Nowak and Mark Coates, Rice University</FONT></P>

<P>In many situations, the ability to determine whether a packet-based communication
network is performing correctly is vital, but the network must not be overburdened
by probing test traffic. If it is determined that the network is functioning
suboptimally, localization of the dysfunction is a key step towards mitigating
the problem. The fundamental objective of this work is to determine the
extent to which unicast, end-to-end network measurement is capable of determining
internal (not directly measurable) packet losses - the so-called network
tomography problem. The major contributions of this paper are two-fold:
we formulate a measurement procedure for network loss inference based on
end-to-end packet pair measurements, and we develop a statistical modeling
and computation framework for inferring internal network loss characteristics.
Simulation experiments demonstrate the potential of our new framework.<BR>

<I><FONT COLOR="#ED181E">Modeling Transmission Loss in a Network with a
Large Number of Nodes<BR>
</FONT></I><FONT COLOR="#ED181E">Jayaram Sethuraman, Florida State University</FONT></P>

<P>Suppose that a signal with an initial strength from an originating node
is transmitted through a network with a large number of intermediate nodes.
There will be dissipation as well as some boosting of the signal between
nodes. We will explore a general probabilistic model for the total loss
in transmission, i.e. for the final strength of signal after passing though
a large number of nodes.</P>

<P>To make the problem more mathematical, we assume that a signal has strength
X_0 at the originating node 0 and it is transmitted through a path consisting
of nodes i=1,2,...,n. Denote the strength of the signal at node i by X_i,
i=1,2,...,n. The nodes themselves do not have to be on a straight line,
they are the nodes along a certain path. The ratio p_i=X_i/X_(i-1) represents
the loss/boost factor at node i; p_i &lt;1 means that there was a loss and
p_i &gt;1 means that there was a boost to the signal at node i. We are interested
in strength X_n of the final signal after it comes through node n, or more
particularly the final loss/boost factor Z_n =X_n/X_0. We present a probabilistic
model for the loss/boost factors p_1,...,p_n and obtain simple limiting
distributions for the final loss/boost factor Z_n. In some models, the mean
of the final loss/boost factor is 1 indicating that on the average there
is no loss. In these cases, one can examine the variance, which we obtain,
to devise systems with tolerable amounts of fluctuations while the same
time there is no loss of strength on the average. In other probabilistic
models, there will be a loss or boost in the strength of the final signal.
This information can be useful in designing robust systems.</P>

</FONT></I><FONT COLOR="#ED181E">David Scott, Rice University</FONT></P>

<P>The use of density estimation to find clusters in data is supplementing
ad hoc hierarchical methodology. Examples include finding high-density regions,
finding modes in a kernel density estimator, and the mode tree. Alternatively,
a mixture model may be fit and the mixture components associated with individual
clusters. Fitting a high-dimensional mixture model with many components
is difficult to estimate in practice. Here, we describe a new algorithm
that estimates a subset of the complete model. In particular, we demonstrate
how to fit one component at a time and how the fits may be organized to
reveal the complete clustering model.</P>

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#ED181E">Estimating Parameters in a Bimodal Distribution<BR>
</FONT></I><FONT COLOR="#ED181E">Douglas Frank, Indiana University, Pennsylvania</FONT></P>

<P>The problem is we have data from a mixture of two populations with unknown
means. The source of each datum cannot be identified. We assume the fraction
of data from one population is an unknown parameter p. We show methods of
estimating the parameter p as well as the means and variances of the mixed
populations. The problem is phrased in terms of fitting bimodal test scores
but has several possible military applications. For instance we may be receiving
fire from two enemy weapon systems with differing rates of fire or kill
ratios. We can estimate the number of each type of weapon as well as its
capabilities with this procedure.</P>

is given for obtaining lower tolerance limits, which are shown to have coverage
virtually equal to the nominal coverage. This procedure eliminates the conservatism
of some previously proposed techniques. Some numerical comparisons with
procedures proposed by G. H. Lemon (1977) and R.W. Mee and D. B. Owen (1983)

Arthur Fries, Institute for Defense Analysis</FONT></P>

<P>When test data are sparse and widely scattered across numerous experimental
factors, the issue of validating any complementary simulation modeling is
problematic. We focus on the extreme case--limited testing within a vast
multi-dimensional design space, and only a single replicate per test--although
results readily generalize. Our only assumptions are that, for each test,
we can measure the associated experimental factor values and input these
into the model to generate extensive simulated data. Under the null hypothesis
that the model accurately portrays reality, this &quot;distribution&quot;
of outcomes facilitates calculation of a p-value. Fisher's combined probability
test, for synthesizing results from different experiments, is then applied
to obtain an overall characterization of the degree of simulation model
&quot;validity&quot;. Other variants of this combination methodology are
also discussed, including generalizations to goodness-of-fit tests for a
uniform distribution. Unique aspects of the model validation problem, vice
the standard statistical hypothesis testing regime, are also noted.</P>

<P>As we begin the 21st century, the state-of-the-art in categorical data
analysis, as in all branches of statistics, is vastly different than at
the start of the 20th century. This article focuses on some of the primary
developments of the past ten to twenty years and discusses areas likely
to see significant progress in coming years. Topics on which I focus are
methods for ordered categorical responses, repeated measurement and clustered
data, and small samples and sparse data. As the literature evolves, the
variety of options for data analysis continues to increase dramatically.
As a consequence, perhaps the greatest challenge now is maintaining adequate
communication among statisticians and between statisticians and other scientists.</P>

<P>There are considerable difficulties in the integration, visualization,
and overall management of battlespace information. One problem that we see
as being very important is the combination of (typically digital) information
from multiple sources in a dynamically evolving environment. In this paper,
we present a spatial-temporal statistical approach to estimating the constantly
changing battlefield, based on noisy data from multiple sources. The potential
danger from an enemy's weapons is examined in the spatial domain and is
extended to incorporate the temporal dimension. Statistical methods for
estimating danger fields are discussed, and an application is given to a
data set generated by a simple object-oriented combat-simulation program
that we have developed. This research was carried out by a group of Ohio
State University statisticians supported by ONR's Probability and Statistics

<P>Fostering information technology research for and technology transfer
to non-R&amp;D government agencies is the focus of a new Digital Government
program at the National Science Foundation. The major Federal statistical
agencies have been involved in the development of the program and recruiting
academic research partners to apply for NSF grants for four years. Our efforts
have been so successful, that $4.2 million of the first year's program funds
were awarded in 4 grants for research related to statistics. Several more
grants have just been awarded as part of the second round of awards. The
partnerships with information technology academic researchers have also
led to their applying for grants under NSF's Information Technology Research
(ITR) program. Some of the partnerships were developed through participation
in what is now called the Digital Government Consortium, which is about
to change its membership rules to encourage broader participation by non-R&amp;D
agencies.</P>

<P>This talk describes Web-based systems, under development at NISS, for
dissemination of disclosure-limited statistical analyses of confidential
data (for example, data collected by Federal agencies such as the Bureau
of Labor Statistics). The essential features of these systems are that:
(1) The results of statistical analyses are disseminated (as opposed to
restricted access via data centers or dissemination of public use microdata);
(2) Disclosure risk for each query is computed dynamically, in light of
previous queries; (3) Strategies may be applied to reduce risk; (4) Analyses
are possible that integrate user data with the confidential data.</P>

</FONT></I><FONT COLOR="#ED181E">James Thompson, Noah Harding Professor
of Statistics, Rice University</FONT></P>

<P>John Tukey died on July 26, 2000 at the age of 85. Only R.A. Fisher might
be said to have had influence comparable to John's on the position of statistics
and science in the modern world. A radical empiricist, Tukey questioned
everything. He doubted the ubiquity of the Gaussian distribution in real
world phenomena, and he proposed ways in which data analysis could be carried
out with a minimum of prior assumptions. His seminal work in time series
analysis was, perhaps, his earliest work in the area which would come to
be called Exploratory Data Analysis. His robustness work showed us what
could be done with a minimalist approach to assumptions about the generating
processes underlying data. In a meeting in 1978, he met a former Princeton
undergraduate who handed him a business card which bore below the former
undergaduate's name the title &quot;Professional Skeptic&quot;. And Tukey
remarked on this as &quot;something that heartened me about what we teach
at Princeton.&quot; John saw the importance that high speed computing would
bring to data analysis, and, in many ways, he should be regarded as a founder
of computer science. He gave us such terms as <I>software </I>and <I>bit</I>
. In many ways, the views of Tukey were found unpalatable by the leaders
of the statistical community early on. I recall that one of his papers required
a five year &quot;review&quot; before being deemed worthy of the <I>Annals</I>.
And yet today, who would question that the philosophy of Tukey has emerged
as one of the most significant in contemporary statistics? Where has Tukey
brought us statisticians to in the Twenty-First Century? This paper proposes
to offer some conjectures.</P>

<P>A recent approach to course of action (COA) generation employs a genetic
algorithm (Fox-GA) to generate a pool of diverse, high quality courses of
action. This pool is intended as an initial set which planners can and adjust
before nominating a subset to the commander. Evaluation of the recommended
COAs by Fox-GA has to date involved either expert opinion as to suitability
or results from the abstract wargame internal to Fox-GA. (A single scenario
is simulated using different COAs over terrain at the National Training
Center, Fort Irwin.) Further, since the concept prototype was a component
of a larger research program in military displays, much of the emphasis
on Fox-GA development has been in perfecting usability.</P>

<P>In a limited scenario, we seek to examine Fox-GA with respect to two
basic questions: (1) how do user controls on Fox-GA affect the quality of
the COA reflected in the battle outcome, (2) how well do Fox-GA recommended
COAs perform in a more widely accepted simulation, Modular Semi-Automated
Forces (ModSAF)? Some information regarding the variability of ModSAF results
also factor in the discussion.</P>

<P>The author's principal concern is how to choose a reasonable response
measure to support evaluation within FoxGA and comparison with ModSAF. A
few measures are proposed. Within the context of the questions we seek to
answer about Fox-GA, what advice can the panel offer?</P>

Complex Models <BR>
</FONT></I><FONT COLOR="#ED181E">MAJ Tom Cioppa and Tom Lucas, Naval Postgraduate
School</FONT></P>

<P>Design of experiments focusing on full and fractional factorial, Latin-hypercube,
super-saturated, and Plackett-Burman designs are quite effective in identifying
main effects or significant interactions where the number of factors is
relatively small. Methodologies such as sequential bifurcation and frequency
domain are also effective at identifying main effects, but assume negligible
interactions. As models become increasingly complex, especially in combat
simulations, these designs may not be effective since interactions can be
highly significant. Finding general patterns of behavior is complicated
by the difficulties associated with exploring high-dimensional non-linear
model surfaces. Existing search tools often restrict analysts to comprehensively
exploring a tiny hyperplane of model space, finding extreme points, or varying
many factors simultaneously by confounding main effects with interactions.
To improve the ability to explore models, a goal is to develop new algorithms
and supporting theory for searching high-dimensional spaces that use search
strategies that automatically look across a breadth of factors and adaptively
focus in on the effects and interactions that are significant. These variable-resolution
sequential designs may combine traditional designs (including full and fractional
factorials, Latin-hypercube, etc.) with newer approaches such as random
perturbations, group screening searches, and frequency domain experiments.
An initial proposed approach is to develop the proposed search strategy
and supporting theory, and then apply the methodology to an agent-based
simulation to examine command and control issues where interactions are
known to be significant.</P>

for Estimation of Infrared Radiance of Ballistic Missiles</FONT></I><BR>
CPT Scott Nestler, United States Military Academy</P>

<P>Atmospheric properties, like temperature and density, can greatly affect
the amount of IR energy that is reflected off an incoming ballistic missile.
While many models to predict mean atmospheric conditions exist, there are
no global models that account for the variability in these properties. This
shortcoming makes it difficult to assess uncertainty due to atmospheric
conditions. For this reason, a model that is adjusted for known extreme
values is needed for use in describing the global behavior of atmospheric
parameters. This study is in support of the Missile and Space Intelligence
Center's development of a Bounded Earth Atmospheric Model (BEAM). This study
will attempt to create such a model through statistical analyses on an existing
atmospheric model. It is expected that BEAM will primarily be used by designers
of IR sensors used in missile defense systems.</P>

University of California, Santa Barbara</FONT></P>

<P>The field of Optimal Network Reliability seems to be a pretty hot topic
among a small group of engineering people. Although it is highly statistical
in nature, few statisticians have become interested in it. It has many applications,
e.g to military environments as well to local area computer networks that
operate in parallel. Such a network is modelled by a probabilistic graph
G in which the points or nodes (i.e., communication centers, satellites,
telephones, missile sites or computer stations) are perfectly reliable but
the edges (representing telephones lines, communication links such as microwaves
or multiply-connected cables) operate independently of one another, each
with a given common known probability p(0&lt;p&lt;1). The network G is in
an operating state iff the surviving edges induce (contain or consist of)
a spanning connected subgraph of the given graph G. We consider only the
all-terminal reliability. For an undirected network with n nodes and e edges,
what is the most reliable network for the given pair (n,e)?It is quite interesting
that a unique optimal graph does exist for many of the pairs (n,e) studied
thus far. In this talk, we present several new conjectures for a graph to
be uniformly optimally reliable (UOR). We also present some new counterexamples
to the known conjectures on UOR graphs in the literature. Finally, we use
Dirichlet methodology and apply it to the above network problems. For example,
we consider different models for the lifetime of the edges and we are interested
in the Expectation and Variance of the resulting (random) time until the
(all-terminal communication) system gets severed (i.e., the networkgets
disconnected).</P>

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#ED181E">Reliability Described by Belief Functions, A
Second Look<BR>
</FONT></I><FONT COLOR="#ED181E">George Hanna, Army Materiel Systems Analysis
Activity</FONT></P>

<P>Glenn Shafer and A. M. Breipohl published the paper Reliability Described
by Belief Functions in the 1979 Proceedings of the Annual Reliability and
Maintainability Symposium of the IEEE. The paper uses Dempster-Shafer belief
functions to assess the reliability of a circuit based on indirect data.
The weakest aspect of the method is the construction of the belief functions.
The belief functions are assumed to be consonant and one-sided, i.e., non-zero
belief is associated only with statements of the form the reliability exceeds
a particular value. Surely there will be occasions when the evidence provides
support for two-sided statements about reliability. Furthermore, the assignment
of confidence levels to belief values though not objectionable is not particularly
compelling.</P>

<P>Since the time of the paper, two developments provide value to a reconsideration
of Dempster-Shafer belief functions for assessment of reliability. First,
is the cost to the Army of obtaining direct data to support verification
of reliability requirements for weapons under development. Some items, such
as missiles, are inherently expensive to test. For other items money available
for testing may be limited due to general reduction in Army funding. Even
when the Army can afford direct verification tests of a developmental system
there is a strong desire to reduce the cost of verification. Consequently,
there is high level interest in new methods to assess both reliability and
other performance characteristics using other than direct system test data.
In fact the Army has sponsored development of a methodology putatively based
on Dempster-Shafer theory to assess reliability using other than direct
data. The second development has been one of the reinterpretations of the
Dempster-Shafer theory. Specifically the interpretation described in the
book A Mathematical Theory of Hints: An approch to the Dempster-Shafer theory
of evidence written by Jurg Kohlas and Paul-Andre Monney and published in
1995. The Kohlas and Monney approach to statistical inference employs a
process model to relate an observable outcome to an unobservable random
variable and a parameter of interest. Process models lead naturally to Dempster-Shafer
belief functions by providing a literal meaning to the concept of a basic
probability assignment that was introduced in Shafer's book, a mathematical
theory of evidence and apparently named because of its formal properties.</P>

<P>The presentation will introduce the process model approach to developing
belief functions. The belief function for binomial data based on a stress-strength
process model will be discussed in detail. A simple model relating indirect
and direct data will be used to illustrate evidentiary combination. The
final part of the presentation will consider some of the obstacles to the
use of process models and Dempster-Shafer theory for reliability assessment.</P>

<P>In 1998 National Research Council issued a study of <I>Statistics, Testing

Defense and the military services should give increased attention to their
reliability, availability, and maintainability data collection and analysis
procedures because deficiencies continue to be responsible for many of the
current field problems and concerns about military readiness.&quot; (Recommendation
7.1,Page 105)</P>

<P>In response to this recommendation and other more pointed observations
on the state of current practice in DoD compared to industry best practices,
the Department asked the National Academies to host a Workshop on Reliability.
A second workshop on software intensive systems will be held next year.
The first workshop was held 9 and 10 June 2000 at the National Academy in
Washington. Speakers and discussants were from industry, academia, and the
Department of Defense. The suggestions from the workshop will be part of
an effort to implement the recommendation to produce &quot; new battery
of military handbooks containing a modern treatment of all pertinent topics
in the fields of reliability and life testing&quot; (Recommendation 7.12,Page126).

<P>This talk proposes many new quantile domain statistical methods for data

means, variances, correlations, and conditional means (regression) we model
distributions, conditional distributions, and rank transforms of the observed

functions, and conditional comparison distributions. For bivariate data
and two samples we propose non-parametric estimation of conditional quantiles
in a new way that provides a unification of classical and modern (parametric
and non-parametric) statistical methods. To identify distributions fitting
one sample we propose Quantile/Quartile plots, which plot quantile/quartile
identification function QI(u)=(Q(u)-QM)/QD, defining mid-quartile QM=.5(Q(.25)+Q(.75)),
quartile deviation QD=.5(Q(.75)-Q(.25)) which estimate location and scale.</P>

Zeroing Methods<BR>
</FONT></I><FONT COLOR="#ED181E">David Webb, Army Research Laboratory and
Bruce Held, RAND</FONT></P>

<P>The accuracy of weapon systems firing unguided ammunition relies on understanding
numerous sources of error and correcting for them. Random errors are addressed
through weapon and ammunition design, production, maintenance, and firing
processes that minimize the magnitude of these error sources. Bias errors
are different in that their magnitude and direction can often be estimated
and then accounted while aiming the weapon. In tanks, estimating the bias
error is a two-part process. First, boresighting is a process that measures
the offset between the fire control system of the tank and the cannon to
compute an aiming correction. Second, the actual firing process imparts
a deviation to the flight path of the trajectory that is different from
what is expected by measuring the pointing direction of the cannon prior
to initiating the shot process. This deviation is often referred to as 'jump'.
Correcting for jump, which normally has a large, nonrandom component, is
called zeroing. Zeroing can be accomplished a number of ways, but the two
most common in tank gunnery are individual zero and fleet zero. Tanks are
individually zeroed when the jump is estimated, usually through actual firing
records, and a unique correction is applied that tank. Fleet zero is a process
by which an average jump value is estimated for a number (fleet) of tanks,
and the correction implied by that average jump is applied to every tank
in the fleet. There are a number of advantages and disadvantages to each
of these processes, but the relative accuracy benefits depend on the magnitude
of the error sources that make up the total error budget for the fleet of
tanks. Although this budget is comprised of numerous error sources, reasonable
accuracy estimates are attainable with basic models of the predominant factors.
This presentation illustrates models for first-shot accuracy under both
zeroing processes to help determine under what conditions each is preferable.</P>

<P>Shelf-life estimation of gun propellants is a situation in which representative
data describing the factors influencing its behavior are not clearly established,
neither is sufficient nor representative of variations presented from lot
to lot. This research applies the concept of fuzzy regression analysis to
model the life of the gun propellant and determines the distribution behavior
that best fitted the relationship. Fuzzy regression takes into account such
aspects as a non-linear relationship between factors, and variation that
might exist between lots. It has been found through a simulation study that
when representative data quality is bad fuzzy regression should not be used,
and instead classical statistical regression analysis should be performed.</P>

Can We Learn From Past Mistakes</FONT></I><FONT COLOR="#ED181E"><BR>
Naomi Oreskes, University of California, San Diego</FONT></P>

<P>In recent years, there has been growing recognition that complex models
of natural systems cannot be validated, and that the term validation is
misleading from both scientific and regulatory standpoints. From a regulatory
standpoint, problems arise because of differences in the way the term validation
is interpreted by expert and lay communities. From a scientific standpoint,
problems arise when we assume that model validation provides confirmation
of the underlying scientific conceptualization.</P>

<P>Most efforts at model validation concentrate on comparing model output
with the natural world. While such comparisons can be useful, they do not
provide adequate basis for confidence in the accuracy of the model. There
have been many cases in the history of science of models that made accurate,
quantitative predictions, but were later shown to be conceptually flawed.
This paper examines three examples. In each case, the conceptual flaws were
not apparent to their designers and users, yet appear obvious in retrospect.
Furthermore, because the flaws were conceptual, quantitative assessment
of model accuracy would not have revealed the underlying problems. Hindsight
suggests that conceptually flawed models may still be useful for the immediate
predictive problems for which they were designed, but they are not reliable
for understanding processes and structures. A well-confirmed model may thus
be acceptable for a design or problem-solving purpose, as long as that purpose
does not require comprehension of underlying causes.</P>
